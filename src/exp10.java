// An employee works in a particular department of an organization. Every employee has an employee number,
// name and draws a particular salary. Every department has a name and a head of department. The head of
// department is an employee. Every year a new head of department takes over. Also, every year an employee is
// given an annual salary enhancement. Identify and design the classes for the above description with suitable
// instance variables and methods. The classes should be such that they implement information hiding. You must
// give logic in support of your design. Also create two objects of each class.
