// Consider a hierarchy, where a sportsperson can either be an athlete or a hockey player. Every sportsperson has
// a unique name. An athlete is characterized by the event in which he/she participates; whereas a hockey player is
// characterized by the number of goals scored by him/her. Perform the following tasks using Java :
//      (i)Create the class hierarchy with suitable instance variables and methods.
//      (ii) Create a suitable constructor for each class.
//      (iii) Create a method named display_all_info with suitable parameters.
//            This method should display all the information about the object of a class.
//      (iv) Write the main method that demonstrates polymorphism
